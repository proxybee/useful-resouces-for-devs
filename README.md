# useful Resouces For Devs

A collection of useful resources for devs and aspiring devs. You can also use this open source to store links to resources you find useful but are unsure how or where to keep them for easy access. Even when you know where to save for easy access, you forget where it was saved, but when you have a whole repository of resources with other devs, it will be difficult to forget. This will also allow you to share resources that you have found valuable with other developers, including new ones.

As we all know and have experienced at some point, information sharing is paramount in technology. Most of us got to where we are today because someone or a group of people were kind enough to share. It is a culture that has aided the fast growth and innovation of the technology industry, so it is only proper to pay it forward.
